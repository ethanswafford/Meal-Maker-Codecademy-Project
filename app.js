// In app.js, create an empty menu object.

// The menu object will hold the meal and price of Today’s Special as properties and they shouldn’t be altered directly.
// Within the menu object, create a _meal property with a value of an empty string('').
// This will eventually hold the name of the meal.

// Next, add a _price property with a value of 0. 
// This will eventually hold the price of the meal, and should also not be altered directly.
